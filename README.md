# Trello-Clone, Event and Task Management

This is project was built following the **Trello-Clone** tutorial by *Antonio Erdeljac*
- [Github Repo](https://www.codewithantonio.com/projects/trello-clone)
- [Tutorial Video](https://www.codewithantonio.com/projects/trello-clone)

It features drag and drop functionality, next.js 14 server actions and event-task management.

No modifications have been made to the project. I am using the techniques learned from this tutorial in other projects
